Workshop papers must follow the [ESEC/FSE 2023 Format and Submission Guidelines](https://2023.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2023-how-to-submit). The workshop follows a double-blind peer review process, aligned with [ESEC/FSE’s Double-Blind Review Process' policies](https://2023.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2023-how-to-submit). Papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way, omitting the names from the submission and referring to self-citations in the third person. The only exception will be dataset and tools papers, which will employ an optional single-blind review process.
