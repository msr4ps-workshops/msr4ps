<b>Dr Nicolás E. Díaz Ferreyra</b> is a senior researcher and lecturer at the Institute of Software Security of Hamburg University of Technology, Germany. His research stands at the intersection of human-computer interaction and privacy engineering, with a special focus on the application of AI and ``digital nudging" to cybersecurity decision-making processes. He has a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Duisburg-Essen, where he worked as a postdoctoral fellow and coordinator of the DFG-funded research training group "User-Centred Social Media". He has taken part in several European projects, including "PDP4E: Methods and tools for GDPR compliance through privacy and data-protection engineering" and "AssureMOSS: Assurance and certification in secure Multi-party Open Software and Services".
<br/>
<i>Related Service Duty:</i> He is the co-organiser of the AiOfAi workshop series on adverse impacts and collateral effects of AI technologies co-located with IJCAI. He has been a PC member in conferences/workshops such as CHI, IFIP-SEC, ARES, CSCW, EuroUSEC, SVM@ICSE, DPM@ESORICS, and IWPE@EuroS&P; and also as a reviewer of journals like JSS, COSE, IST, and SoSyM.
