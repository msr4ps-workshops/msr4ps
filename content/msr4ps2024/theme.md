## {{< param title >}}

The last decades have put Privacy and Security (P&S) in the spotlight of information technology as data breaches and cyberattacks have spiked globally. Still, P&S are often afterthoughts in software development as their benefits are sometimes difficult to demonstrate and their costs hard to justify. However, such technical debt is becoming hard to sustain as new legal frameworks, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), demand companies to incorporate P&S features (e.g., transparency, anonymity, and informed consent) at the core of their products. Hence, there is an urgent call for tools and methods supporting the elicitation and deployment of P&S requirements in by-design approach.

P&S are multifaceted and complex research areas spanning across different knowledge domains (e.g., engineering, law, and psychology). Challenges in P&S cannot be solely addressed from a single discipline as they often involve human factors, technological artefacts, and regulatory/legal frameworks. Particularly, the quest for P&S solutions requires in-deep knowledge and actionable information about its users/stakeholders, vulnerabilities/flaws, and potential attackers.

Mining Software Repositories (MSR) techniques can support this quest by providing means to understand the P&S dimensions of information systems, thus help shaping privacy- and security-friendly software. This workshop aims to explore the application of MSR at the different stages of P&S engineering.

## Topics of Interest

We invite MSR researchers and practitioners across multiple disciplines and knowledge backgrounds to submit contributions dealing with the following (or related) topics:

- MSR applications for security risk assessment
- MSR applications for privacy requirements engineering
- MSR applications for security vulnerabilities detection
- Engineering PETs through MSR methodologies
- Privacy-Enhancing Technologies through MSR
- MSR-based research for safety/security by design
- Privacy-friendly MSRs (including mixed-methods)
- MSR-based mixed-methods on P&S research
- Privacy requirements in MSR-based research
- Integrating MSRs into P&S research (empirical)
- Analysis of repositories to mine for P&S research
- Tools supporting MSR-based research for P&S
- Datasets used for MSR-based research for P&S
- MSR applications to P&S assurance

> Any paper within the scope of the workshop will be considered. Additionally, this year we specially welcome submissions elaborating on MSR for the analysis and extraction of privacy and security anti-patternsâ€“namely, solutions that demonstrate knowledge of poor development practices.
