### Keynote: _Assessing the Scalability of Microservice Architectures_
 
Microservices have emerged as an architectural style for developing maintainable and scalable applications. Assessing the performance of architecture deployment configurations ‚Äî e.g., with respect to deployment alternatives ‚Äî is challenging and must be aligned with the system usage in the production environment. In this talk I present an approach for using operational profiles to generate load tests to automatically assess scalability pass/fail criteria of microservice configuration alternatives. The approach provides a domain-based metric for each alternative that can, for instance, be applied to make informed decisions about the selection of alternatives and to conduct production monitoring regarding performance-related system properties, e.g., anomaly detection. We have evaluated our approach using extensive experiments in a large bare metal host environment and a virtualized environment. The talk with briefly introduce the concept of microservices, present the deployment approach and the evaluation approach based on the open source tool locust.io; it will present the tool PPTAM used to conduct the experiments and the performed data analysis.

**[Dr. Andrea Janes](https://ajanes.github.io) is an associate professor at the Free University of Bozen/Bolzano.** He was previously a senior lecturer and researcher at the FHV Vorarlberg University of Applied Sciences in Dornbirn, Austria, and a researcher at the Free University of Bozen/Bolzano, Italy. He received his master's degree in computer science from the Technical University of Vienna, Austria and the doctorate in computer science (with distinction) from the University of Klagenfurt (Austria). He holds a Master's degree in Business Informatics from the Vienna University of Technology and a PhD in Computer Science (with honors) from the University of Klagenfurt, Austria. He obtained the habilitation in Computer Science and Information processing systems. He is particularly interested in Lean and Agile approaches to software engineering, value-based software engineering, empirical software engineering, software testing, and technology transfer.
