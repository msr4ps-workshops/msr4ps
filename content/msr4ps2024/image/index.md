### Keynote: _MSR for Security--Data Quality Issues, Lessons from Trenches_
 
Software repositories are an attractive source of data for understanding the burning security issues challenging developers, anecdotal solutions, and building AI/ML-based models and tools. That is why there is exponential growth in the literature based on mining software repositories for software security. While the abundance of freely available data for research is a fortune, the data quality issues can make software repositories minefields capable of blowing any time and effort budget for a project. Our group has been active in this area for the last few years to develop knowledge, understanding, and tools for improving software security by mining repositories. Through a mix of successful and failed efforts, we have experienced firsthand what is called “garbage in, garbage out” due to poor data quality. Without fully appreciating the data quality issues, starting a data-driven software security project can be frustrating and disheartening for a research team. We believe engaging the relevant stakeholders in developing and sharing knowledge and technologies to improve software security data quality is crucial. To this end, we are not only systematically identifying and synthesizing the existing empirical literature on improving data quality but also devising innovative solutions for addressing the data quality challenges while mining software repositories for software security. This talk will draw lessons and recommendations from our efforts of systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art and developing solutions for improving data quality while building knowledge, understanding, and tools for supporting software security. The talk will use a selected set of our studies to demonstrate the concrete cases of the challenges faced and the used workarounds to successfully continue our journey of learning and improving in this line of research and practice.

**[M. Ali Babar](http://malibabar.wordpress.com) is a Professor in the School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Australia.** He leads a theme on architecture and platform for security as service in [CyberSecurity Cooperative Research Centre](https://cybersecuritycrc.org.au ), a large initiative funded by the Australian government, industry, and research institutes.  Prior to joining the University of Adelaide, he was a Reader in Software Engineering with the School of Computing and Communication at Lancaster University, UK. After joining the University of Adelaide, Prof Babar established an interdisciplinary research centre called [CREST (Centre for Research on Engineering Software Technologies)](https://www.crest-centre.net ), where he directs the research and education activities of more than 30 researchers and engineers in the areas of Software Systems Engineering, Security and Privacy, and Social Computing. Professor Babar’s research team draws a significant amount of cash funding and in-kind resources from governmental and industrial organisations. Professor Babar has authored/co-authored more than 270 peer-reviewed research papers at premier Software journals and conferences. Professor Babar obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the school of computer science and engineering of University of New South Wales, Australia. He also holds a M.Sc. degree in Computing Sciences from University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.
