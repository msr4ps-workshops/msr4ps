<h5 id="submission-deadline-extended-july-31st-anywhere-on-earth-2022">SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED: JULY 31st (anywhere on earth), 2022</h5>
<p>The last decades have put Privacy and Security (P&amp;S) in the spotlight of information technology as data breaches and cyberattacks have spiked globally. Still, P&amp;S are often afterthoughts in software development as their benefits are sometimes difficult to demonstrate and their costs hard to justify <strong>[6,8]</strong>. However, such technical debt is becoming hard to sustain as new legal frameworks, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), demand companies to incorporate P&amp;S features (e.g., transparency, anonymity, and informed consent) at the core of their products <strong>[6]</strong>. Hence, there is an urgent call for tools and methods supporting the elicitation and deployment of P&amp;S requirements in <em>by-design</em> approach.</p>
<p>P&amp;S are multifaceted and complex research areas spanning across different knowledge domains (e.g., engineering, law, and psychology) <strong>[1,5]</strong>. Challenges in P&amp;S cannot be solely addressed from a single discipline as they often involve human factors, technological artefacts, and regulatory/legal frameworks <strong>[3,9]</strong>. Particularly, the quest for P&amp;S solutions requires in-deep knowledge and actionable information about its users/stakeholders, vulnerabilities/flaws, and potential attackers <strong>[4,5]</strong>.</p>
<p>Mining Software Repositories (MSR) techniques can support this quest by providing means to understand the P&amp;S dimensions of information systems, thus help shaping privacy- and security-friendly software. This workshop aims to explore the application of MSR at the different stages of P&amp;S engineering <strong>[2,7]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of Interest</h2>
<p>For this, we invite MSR researchers and practitioners across multiple disciplines and knowledge backgrounds to submit contributions dealing with the following (or related) topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSR applications for security risk assessment</li>
<li>MSR applications for privacy requirements engineering</li>
<li>MSR applications for security vulnerabilities detection</li>
<li>Engineering PETs through MSR methodologies</li>
<li>Privacy-Enhancing Technologies through MSR</li>
<li>MSR-based research for safety/security by design</li>
<li>Privacy-friendly MSRs (including mixed-methods)</li>
<li>MSR-based mixed-methods on P&amp;S research</li>
<li>Privacy requirements in MSR-based research</li>
<li>Integrating MSRs into P&amp;S research (empirical)</li>
<li>Analysis of repositories to mine for P&amp;S research</li>
<li>Tools supporting MSR-based research for P&amp;S</li>
<li>Datasets used for MSR-based research for P&amp;S</li>
<li>MSR applications to P&amp;S assurance</li>
</ul>
<p>Any paper within the scope of the workshop will be considered. Additionally, this year we specially welcome submissions elaborating on <strong>MSR for the analysis and extraction of privacy and security anti-patterns</strong>&ndash;namely, solutions that demonstrate knowledge of poor development practices.</p>
